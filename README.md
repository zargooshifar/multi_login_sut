# multi_login_sut

i wrote this code in python some time in the past for bypassing the bandwidth limitation of internet of my university (Sahand university of tech.)

the logic behind this program is to get multiple ip from server and login to each of them separately, and guess what? it's actually works!


requirements:

[python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

u need to add nd.exe to root directory of project (its node js, just download binaries from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and copy node.exe and rename it to nd.exe)


how to run this nonsense?!

just open jiz!.py and follow the instructions!
